 UNLOCode Viewer

This app reads a master list of UN/LO Codes downloaded from the UNECE (see below for improvment)
and shows the location of the nearest UNLOC positions from own position to select suitable 
position for reporting.

Now uses the much improved List of UN/LOCodes from _https://github.com/cristan/improved-un-locodes_
A load of thanks to Christan for taking the time to find and include the positions of several Codes.
